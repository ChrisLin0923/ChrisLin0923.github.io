        <p class=story_verticle_text> It was a cloudy day, and I remember that I prayed for the weather to get a little brighter. It was my first time walking across the Manhattan Bridge, despite the dull weather, I was amazed by the view of the city. Half way through the bridge, the clouds opened up, and the sunset luminated the clouds, buildings, and highway. I snapped this photo, capturing the motion of the cars, and the lively city.
