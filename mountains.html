            <p class=story_text> This photo was taken on top of the Kaateskill mountain, inside of an watch tower. I was asthonished by the grand view that stood before my eyes. The sunset was generously radianting the mountains. The swift winds brushed across our faces. We were able to see the layers of mountains that laid next to each other. We couldn't hold back the urge to praise God, for His grand design.</p>
